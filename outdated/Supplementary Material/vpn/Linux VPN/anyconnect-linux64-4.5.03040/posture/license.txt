License Terms and Conditions 

1. License.  Conditioned upon compliance with the terms and conditions of the Agreement, Cisco grants to You a nonexclusive, nontransferable and non-sublicenseable license to allow Devices to use the Software for your internal business purposes.  Your right to use the Software is limited to that number of Authorized End Users for which You have paid the applicable fee, plus that number of Unattended Endpoints for which You have paid the applicable fee. In order to use the Software You may be required to input a registration number or product authorization key and register your copy of the Software online at Cisco’s website to obtain the necessary license key or license file.  You should refer to the Ordering Guide and/or Administrator Guide for the applicable features for the Software You have licensed.  This SEULA will apply to Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client v4.0 and any subsequent versions thereto unless a different SEULA is adopted for such subsequent versions.

2. Permitted Third Party Use.  You may copy and distribute the Software to your third party business partners and customers from a password protected software download site, solely and exclusively for the purposes of accessing your Devices, provided that You shall remain solely responsible for compliance with the Agreement by each such third party, and each such distribution of the Software to a third party is accompanied by a copy of the Agreement.  In the event of termination of the Agreement, You must use commercially reasonable efforts to notify all third parties to whom You have distributed the Software that their rights of access and use of the Software has also terminated.

3. License Term.  Unless You purchase a perpetual license which will only be permitted in limited instances for certain Software, your license is a term-based subscription to use the Software for a defined period of time as indicated in a SKU or as otherwise shown in the Ordering Document.  The subscription term is subject to the termination provisions under the EULA.  You must renew each subscription license and pay the applicable fee before the subscription expiration date for continued authorized use of the Software. If a subscription term expires without renewal, then your right and license to use the Software automatically terminates.  Additionally, certain Software features and services may cease operation if You do not renew your subscription.

Your use of Cisco Network Devices is subject to separate license entitlements and restrictions that are not covered by this Agreement. Each Cisco Network Device may need to be registered for use with your license.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a Network Access Manager Module, as described in the Administrator Guide, may be used by You in conjunction with non-Cisco wired and wireless equipment for the purpose of connecting to non-Cisco network equipment. 

5. Rules. If Cisco provides You with application IDs, signatures or rules for use with any Software (collectively, the "Rules"), then such Rules, and all modifications and updates thereto, are provided on an "AS IS" basis without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied, including, without limitation, warranties that the Rules are free of defects, merchantable, fit for a particular purpose, error-free or non-infringing.

6. Permitted Legacy Use.  If You previously purchased a license to use a prior version of AnyConnect that included a license to use such prior version on mobile platforms, then your End Users covered by such license are hereby granted a license to use AnyConnect v4.0 on their Endpoints at no additional charge until April 30, 2016.  Any such use shall be governed by this Agreement and shall not include a license for You to use Cisco AnyConnect Enterprise Application Selector, which license must be separately purchased.

For Software licensed on a subscription basis, You will also receive Cisco Software Application Support plus Upgrades (SASU) as part of the subscription fee.  For Software licensed on a perpetual basis, You must separately purchase a support contract to receive maintenance and technical support. A separate support contract is also required for You to receive maintenance and technical support for (a) Cisco Network Devices, (b) Cisco products used in conjunction with the Network Access Manager Module, and (c) other Cisco services.

Consent to Data Collection and Privacy 

1. Data Collection and Processing.  Cisco may, as part of your use of the Software and/or the provision of services by Cisco, collect, retain, and use Non-Personal Information and specific identifiable data about You, your network and your Endpoints (e.g., Endpoint IDs, IP addresses, location, content, etc.).  Some of this specific identifiable data may contain Personal Information. Cisco also may transfer data so collected to Cisco’s offices and subsidiaries in the United States and other countries where Cisco or its service providers have facilities.

2. Purpose of Data Collection and Processing. The data Cisco collects from the Software is necessary for the essential use and functionality of the Software (e.g. device tracking, access control, data and traffic analysis, threat detection, malware and conduct-related analysis, etc.), and is also used by Cisco to provide associated services and to improve the operation and functionality of the Software. For these reasons You may not be able to opt out from some of this data collection other than by uninstalling or disabling the Software.  You may have the ability, however, to configure the Software to limit some of the data that can be collected, as described in the applicable Documentation and Administrator Guide.  For example, You may: (a) withdraw your consent to collection, use, processing and storage of Non-personal Information collected by the Customer Experience Feedback Module at any time by turning the module off; and (b) withdraw your consent to collection, use, processing and storage of Personal Information collected by the Web Security Module at any time by configuring the Cisco Cloud Web Security Filtering Service to anonymize your end user data.

3. Consent to Data Collection and Use. By using the Software and/or subscribing to related Cisco-provided services and accepting these terms, You agree to the collection, use, transfer, backup, and storage of your Personal Information and other data by Cisco and its service providers. Cisco will not process this information other than in accordance with Cisco’s Privacy Statement (identified in section 4 below).  You also agree that Cisco and its service providers may, as part of your use of the Software and the provision of related services by Cisco, transfer, copy, backup and store your Personal Information and other data in the United States, Europe, or other countries or jurisdictions outside your own where data protection standards may be different.
